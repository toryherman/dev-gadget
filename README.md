Dev Gadget is a Google Chrome extension which allows you to select text elements on any web page and easily copy their relevant CSS. Simply enable the extension by clicking the icon, then hover over any text element and the CSS will be displayed at the top of the window. Clicking on an element will copy the CSS to your clipboard.
